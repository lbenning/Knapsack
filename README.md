# Knapsack

## Overview

* This is a project that applies genetic algorithms to the 0/1
knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a hard problem in combinatorial
optimization and is known to be NP-Complete. Assuming the widely held conjecture
that P is unequal to NP, there is no Polynomial Time algorithm that solves
for the optimal solution exactly. We therefore turn to approximation methods,
and genetic algorithms are a type of state-space search method known to excel
at approximating solutions to discrete optimization problems.

## Running

* The project contains two different simulations that can be ran.

1. The first simulation benchmarks three genetic algorithms against the Knapsack
Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS).

2. The second simulation benchmarks four genetic algorithms against Simulated
Annealing and Random Search, which are parametric optimization methods.

* For more details on how to run the simulations, please see running.txt in the src
folder.
