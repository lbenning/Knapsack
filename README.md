# Knapsack

## Overview

* This is a project that applies genetic algorithms to the 0/1 Knapsack problem, a hard problem in combinatorial optimization. 

## Running

* There are two different simulations that can be ran.

1. The first simulation benchmarks three genetic algorithms against the Knapsack
Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS).

2. The second simulation benchmarks four genetic algorithms against Simulated
Annealing and Random Search, which are parametric optimization methods.

* For more details on how to run the simulations, please see running.txt in the src
folder.
